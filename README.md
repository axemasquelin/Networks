### Welcome to [Networks](/Networks/).
 This repository is a collection of DNN architectures implemented in Pytorch by me. The goal of this repository
is to build a library of models that can be quickly be deployed for my various research needs, and to better familiarize myself with current DNN research. Note that the majority of these models will have personal modifications for my current needs, for true implementations please refer to Pytorch website for pretrained models.

#### Models:
- [DenseNets](/Networks/src/DenseNets.py)
- [MobileNets](/Networks/src/MobileNets.py)
- [EfficientNets](/Networks/src/EfficientNet.py)
- [Inception Module](/Networks/src/Inceptions.py)
